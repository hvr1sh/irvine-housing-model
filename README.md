# irvine-housing-model

This is a ML project designed to predict the home prices in Irvine, CA ((my home town). This model is about 82% accurate. The data for this model is from Redfin.

Future Plans
------------
1. Make a font end for the application
2. Expand the database and allow for live updating
3. Implament grandient boosting to increase accuracy

Shortcomings
-------------
The training dataset is small (about 600 homes). More homes will increase accuracy drasticaly.
